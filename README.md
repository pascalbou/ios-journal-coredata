# Journal (Core Data) Day 2

## Instructions

Use the Journal project you made yesterday. Create a new branch called `day2`. When you finish today's instructions and go to make a pull request, be sure to select the original repository's `day2` branch as the base branch, and your own `day2` branch as the compare branch.

### Part 1 - Mood Feature

#### Segmented Control Addition

1. Add a `UISegmentedControl` to the `CreateEntryViewController` scene. 
2. Make 3 segments.
3. Set each segment's title to a mood. It's recommended to set them to happy, sad, and neutral emoji for the three moods, but you can choose anything you want.
4. Make an outlet from the segmented control to the view controller's class file.

#### Data Model Updates and Migration

Now, you will update your Core Data model to include a property to hold the mood that the user selects on the segmented control.

1. Select your Core Data data model file. In the menu, select Editor -> Add Model Version (keep it the same name and click the "Finish" button).
2. In the new data model file, add a new attribute called `mood`. Set its type to be `String`. 
3. Give the `mood` a default value. The default value is üòê, the neutral emoji. Again, you can choose whichever 3 moods you want. Just make sure to set the default value of this attribute to one of them.  This will allow the `Entry` objects that have been created before `mood` was added to have an initial value. 
4. In the File Inspector with the data model file selected, set the current model version to the new model version you just created. (It should be something like `Journal 2`)
5. Now navigate to your "Entry+Convenience.swift" file where you have the `Entry` extension and convenience initializer.
6. Add a `Mood` enum that has a `String` raw value. Set your cases to whatever three moods you chose. Make the enum conform to the `CaseIterable` protocol.
7. Update the initializer to include and property initialize the new `mood` property. Have the initializer take a `Mood` enum value, and then use the `rawValue` to actually set the property in the managed object.
8. In `CreateEntryViewController` update the code to collect the mood from the segmented control and then pass the appropriate `Mood` enum value into the `Entry` initializer.
    - **NOTE:** You'll need to translate the selected segment index into a `Mood` enum value. Use the `allCases` property of the enum to help you out, and look at the guided project for this module to see how you did it there.

At this point, take the time to test your project. Make sure that:
- Entries that you have saved before adding the `mood` property have a default `mood` value added to them.
- Moods get saved correctly to new entries.

#### Part 2 - NSFetchedResultsController Implementation

You will now implement an `NSFetchedResultsController` to manage displaying entries on and handling interactions with the table view.

##### EntriesTableViewController

1. In the `EntriesTableViewController`, create a lazy stored property called `fetchedResultsController`. Its type should be `NSFetchedResultsController<Entry>`. It should be initialized using a closure. Inside the closure:
    - Create a fetch request from the `Entry` object.
    - Create a sort descriptor that will sort the entries based on their `mood`. This can be either ascending or descending depending on your preference.
    - Create a sort descriptor that will sort the entries based on their `timestamp`. This can also be either ascending or descending depending on your preference.
    - Give the sort descriptor to the fetch request's `sortDescriptors` property. Note that this property's type is an array of sort descriptors, not a single one.
    - Create a constant that references your core data stack's `mainContext`.
    - Create a constant and initialize an `NSFetchedResultsController` using the fetch request and managed object context. For the `sectionNameKeyPath`, put "mood" (exactly how you spelled it in the data model file), and `nil` for `cacheName`.
    - Set this view controller class as the delegate of the fetched results controller. **NOTE:** Xcode will give you an error, but you will fix it in just a second.
    - Perform the fetch request using the fetched results controller
    - Return the fetched results controller.
2. Adopt the `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` protocol in an extension to this view controller.
3. Add the following delegate methods to the table view controller: (feel free to paste this code in if you made a snippet out of it)
    - `controllerWillChangeContent`.
    - `controllerDidChangeContent`.
    - `didChange sectionInfo` ... `atSectionIndex`.
    - `didChange anObject` ... `at indexPath`.

Now you will change the `UITableViewDataSource` methods to look to the fetched results controller for information about how to set up the table view instead of the (no longer existing) `entries` array in the `EntryController`.

4. Add the `numberOfSections(in tableView: ...)` method if you don't have it already. This should use the number of sections in the fetched results controller's `sections` array.
5. In the `numberOfRowsInSection`, Again, use the `section` parameter to get the section currently being set up to return the `numberOfObjects`.
6. In the `cellForRowAt`, use the fetched results controller's `object(at: IndexPath)` method to get the correct entry corresponding to the cell instead of using the `entries` array.
7. In the `commit editingStyle`, use the `object(at: IndexPath)` method again to get the correct entry to be deleted instead of using the `entries` array.
8. Use the same `object(at: IndexPath)` method in the `prepare(for segue: ...)` method to get the correct entry instead of using the `entries` array.

#### Part 3 - Detail View

1. Create an `EntryDetailViewController` file that subclasses `UIViewController`
2. Add a view controller scene to your storyboard and link it with a segue between the cell and the view (use _show_ for the kind). This should extend the navigation bar to the new scene.
3. Assign the `EntryDetailViewController` class to the new scene in the identity inspector.
4. Set the title to `Entry Details`.
5. Copy and paste the stackview of views from the create scene to this one (you might consider breaking the connections to the outlets and actions before you copy/paste. Sometimes Xcode can get confused about the connections on copied views. Just be sure to reconnect them afterwards).
6. Constrain the stackview in the detail view scene with the following:
    - leading, top, and trailing of 20 pts (with margins)
    - equal height to the superview (will end up with a proportional height constraint; ensure the multiplier is 0.4)
7. Create outlets in the detail view controller for: the textfield, the text view, and the segmented control
8. Create an optional property to store an `Entry` object, and a variable Bool called `wasEdited` defaulted to `false`
9. In `viewDidLoad`, set the `editButtonItem` to the `rightBarButtonItem` in the `navigationItem` property.
    - Also call `updateViews` (which you'll create next)
10. Create and fill in the `updateViews` method. Set the views onscreen to the data from the `entry` model object. Also set the textfield, text view, and segmented control's `isUserInteractionEnabled` properties to `isEditing`.
11. Override the `setEditing(_:animated:)` method.
    - Call the superclass implementation
    - Check the `editing` property, if it's true set the `wasEdited` property to true
    - Set the 3 outlets' `isUserInteractionEnabled` properties to the `editing` variable
    - Set the `navigationItem`'s `hidesBackButton` property also to `editing` (this will hide the back button whenever editing is enabled)
12. Override the `viewWillDisappear(_:)` method
    - Call the superclass implementation
    - Check if `wasEdited` is true. If so, collect entry data from the user interface controls and update the `entry` managed object
    - Call save on the main context from your `CoreDataStack` singleton
